### Planned Features ###

1. JoloJ will explore under 3m depth.
2. PVC will be used as the primary construction material.
3. 2 Buoyancy chambers will be used for diving and lifting.
4. 6 Thrusters for 5 DOF motion.
5. Hand to rescue under water rings(!). Like the second secret copy of the Lord of the rings!
6. Camera for video feed.
7. Sensors:
    1. Motion sensor for automatic balancing capability.
    2. Temperature Sensor.
    3. Pressure Sensor.
8. External high capacity battery.
