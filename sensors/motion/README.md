For motion sensing we are using [MPU6050 chip](http://www.invensense.com/products/motion-tracking/6-axis/mpu-6050/).

We are using [I2Cdev](https://github.com/jrowberg/i2cdevlib/tree/master/Arduino/I2Cdev) and [MPU6050](https://github.com/jrowberg/i2cdevlib/tree/master/Arduino/MPU6050) library by [Jeff Rowberg](https://github.com/jrowberg).
